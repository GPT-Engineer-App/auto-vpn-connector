# auto-vpn-connector

I want to build an automation website to develop a VPN application utilising diode cli from diode.io. The application will allow the installation of diode and register all clients for point-to-point communications. This will rival the tail scale and be easy for non-technical users to use as it downloads the client and automates the connections to each endpoint. The automation website front end should automate the client on Windows, Mac and Linux. The client front end will allow users to select various endpoints to make it easy to change location using the proxy capability of diode cli. The example I am using is here https://support.diode.io/article/uvmsbqnlqi-host-a-decentralized-private-proxy-server
